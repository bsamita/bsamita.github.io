I'm Brown — a **network security enthusiast** transitioning into cybersecurity from an unconventional background in ministry and business.

I focus on **network security, SOC operations, and firewall configuration**. I learn by building: home labs, security monitoring systems, and documented projects.

**What I do:**
- Configure and harden network infrastructure
- Analyze traffic and detect threats
- Build SOC environments (Wazuh, Security Onion, pfSense)
- Document everything I learn

**Currently:**
- CCNA certified
- Building hands-on experience through 500+ lab hours
- Seeking entry-level roles in Network Security or SOC
