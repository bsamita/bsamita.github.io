# Hi, I'm Brown 👋

## Network Security Enthusiast | CCNA Certified | SOC Analyst

**From pastor and restaurant owner to cybersecurity professional** — my unconventional path is my advantage.

I'm passionate about **network security, firewall configuration, and SOC operations**. I learn by doing: building labs, analyzing traffic, and documenting everything. My focus is on **network defense, incident response, and secure infrastructure design**.
