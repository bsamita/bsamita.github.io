I am a cybersecurity enthusiast with a background in networking (CCNA) and a growing focus on Security Operations and cloud security.

I enjoy breaking down security problems, analyzing logs, and understanding attacker behavior in order to build stronger defenses.

My interests include:
- SOC operations and alert triage
- Network security and monitoring
- Cloud security fundamentals
- Defensive security research

I actively document my learning to improve my technical depth and communication skills.
