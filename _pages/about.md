## From Ministry and Business to Cybersecurity

I transitioned into cybersecurity in early 2025 after working in ministry leadership and restaurant management. These roles required strong crisis management, analytical thinking, and clear communication under pressure — skills that translate directly into **security operations and incident response**.

My technical focus is on **network security** and **SOC analysis**, with a strong interest in firewall configuration, traffic analysis, and documenting secure architectures.

## What I Do

I take a hands-on approach to learning by building, testing, and analyzing security environments. My work typically involves:
- Configuring and hardening security devices and networks  
- Monitoring logs and identifying potential threats  
- Documenting architectures, findings, and lessons learned  
- Practicing through structured, real-world labs  

I have built a personal **home SOC lab** using **Wazuh, Security Onion, and pfSense** to simulate real security monitoring workflows. I document my projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/bsamita) and write technical guides aimed at making complex security concepts clear and accessible.
